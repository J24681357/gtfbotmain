## Basics & How To Start
### Navigation And Controls
1. The GT Fitness: Fithusim game can be played via the slash command list in Discord ( / ), where many of its commands can be found.

2. Each menu will generally have directional buttons and confirm buttons for navigation.

### Starting Fithusim Life
3. You may start the main game by selecting the Fithusim Life mode in the `/home` menu, or enter the slash command, `/fithusimlife`. When you start a new game for the first time in a Generation, you must select a starter car in order to continue.
   ðŸ’¡ You may change cars at any time; however, changing cars will advance the calender by 1 week.

## Fithusim Life - /fithusimlife
1. In Fithusim Life, the goal of this mode is to reach for the Top 6 rank in order to be eligible for one of the King races. To complete Fithusim Life for one Generation, you must win the race. There are a total of 3 Generations and must be completed in chronological order.
   - ðŸ’¡ Just like the 2005 game, Enthusia Profressional Racing, having a very fast car may not influence your rank quickly. 

3. In Fithusim Life, each generation consists of races with cars throughout a certain time period:
   - Generation 1 (1960 - 1989)
   - Generation 2 (1990 - 2009)
   - Generation 3 (2010 - Present)
You may switch between Generations in the `/home` slash command and select "Generation Select".
   - ðŸ’¡ Note that when switching Generations, your ranking, week, enthu points, and starter car will be reset. However, any collected cars and tuning levels will remain when applicable.
     
2. In the main menu for Fithusim Life, here are brief descriptions of each options:
    - Go Race: Participate in league races to increase your ranking & skill points
    - Change Car: Change to collected cars from a Generation
    - 

4. Special events have special prizes and new ways to gain more credits, cars, and EXP points. 
5. Special events must be completed in order. In order to progress through special events, you must achieve an average of 3rd place or Bronze from each set of races/time trials.

6. As detailed, each career event has different regulations/settings in the following:
    - Set of races or championship
    - FPP limit, power limit, & weight limit
    - Maximum tire grade
    - Manufacturer, model, car type, etc
    - BOP (Balance of Performance)
    - Dynamic weather: Weather change over time with a certain probability
7. In the Career Event screen, you can select from different races that you want to participate in. As detailed, the following are shown:
    - Race list (Use the buttons to select the race associated with the list)
    - Standings: Toggles the credit rewards screen
    - Exit: Returns to the previous screen
      - ðŸ’¡ If the event is regulated with BOP, all cars will have similar performance regardless of tuning for fair gameplay.
      - ðŸ’¡ If the event is a championship, all races must be completed in order to earn credits. When you start a session, you will be `pinged` for every race completed, followed by the points standings (the transition is automated every 20 seconds).
