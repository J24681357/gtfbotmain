## Basics & How To Start
### Navigation And Controls
1. The GT Fitness: Fithusim game can be played via the slash command list in Discord ( / ), where many of its commands can be found.

2. Each menu will generally have directional buttons and confirm buttons for navigation.

3. Cars in Fithusim are ranked by class. Cars are rated based on performance: F, E, D, C, B, A (from lowest to highest). Like in the 2005 racing game, Enthusia Professional Racing, the R class represents race cars and rally cars regardless of performance.

### Starting Fithusim Life
1. You may start the main game by selecting the Fithusim Life mode in the `/home` menu, or enter the slash command, `/fithusimlife`. When you start a new game for the first time in a Generation, you must select a starter car in order to continue.
   - ðŸ’¡ You may change cars at any time; however, changing cars will advance the calender by 1 week.

## Fithusim Life - /fithusimlife
1. In Fithusim Life, you will start at the bottom of the rankings, 1000. The goal of is to reach for the Top 6 rank in order to be eligible for one of the King races. To complete Fithusim Life for one Generation, you must win at least one King race. There are a total of 3 Generations and must be completed in chronological order.
   - ðŸ’¡ Like in Enthusia, faster cars influence less of your ranking compared to slower cars. 

3. In Fithusim Life, each generation consists of races with cars throughout a certain time period:
   - Generation 1 (1960 - 1989)
   - Generation 2 (1990 - 2009)
   - Generation 3 (2010 - Present)
     - ðŸ’¡ You can switch between Generations in the `/home` slash command and select "Generation Select (Fithusim Life)".
     - ðŸ’¡ Note that when switching Generations, your ranking, week, Enthu points, and starter car will be reset. However, any collected cars and tuning levels will remain form each Generation, and you will be selectable as a starter car.
     
2. In the main menu for Fithusim Life, here are brief descriptions of each options:
    - Go Race: Participate in league races to increase your ranking & skill points
    - Change Car: Changes from collected cars in a Generation and restore some Enthu points (advances one week)
    - Rest: Fully restores Enthu points and advances one week
    - Garage: Views collected cars in a Generation by class
    - Records: View records of past races in Fithusim Life

### Leagues
1. In the Go Race section, events are categorized by Race Gades (from RN to RIV-RI to RS). Your ranking/ranking points determine on eligible race grades that you can enter. The higher the race grade, the longer the races & harder AI opponents are in each race grade.

2. In the menu for each Race Grade, there are a list of races you can participate it. The races are sorted by odds from each of the grids. The higher the odds, the better ranking you can earn.
   
4. When you select a race, you are presented race details for the event. In the order from top to bottom:
    - Track
    - Event Name
    - The amount of ranking points for finishing in each position
        - Ranking points earned is determined by the Race Grade, odds of your current car, and finishing position (Race Grade x Odds x Race Result).
        - ðŸ’¡ Unlike in Enthusia, you can earn ranking points for placing in 5th and 6th place, but they are not displayed.
    - The Starting Grid
        - Relative to the grid, faster cars will have smaller odds and vice versa. Use odds as an advantage in determining whether to participate in the race.  

### Pre Race And Pre Session Screen
 1. In the pre-session menu, buttons and menus can be seen before staring the session. As detailed, these are the following options:
    - Driver Pace (Drop-down menu): Selects a driver pace that determines the race strategy. There are 3 options:
      - Passive: A slower pace where the driver drives more passively, thus reducing driving performance. This pace decreases the amount of damage & mistakes during the race; however, you will earn more Skill points.
      - Neutral: A normal pace between passive and aggression.
      - Aggressive: An aggressive pace with optimal driving performance but prone to reckless driving. You will earn less Skill points from damages; however, driving performance improves.
    - Start: Starts the race/session. You can not restart the race while it is in session.
    - Grid: Toggles between the grid details and the track information screen

2. When you start, there will be a timer to wait until the session finishes and return your results.
    - ðŸ’¡ The timer progresses in real time.
3. While the race/session is in progress, you can view the race information in the embed including the grid, current position, and track information.
   - ðŸ’¡ You can also view the status of your session by using `/status`, to receive the message link and time remaining of the session.
4. When a race/session is completed, you will be notified via ping and the results will appear containing:
   - Finishing position
   - Total Ranking points earned
   - Total amount of Enthu points lost due to collisions and offroading
   - Grid standings

### Rival Car Raffle
1. Finishing a race in 4th place or better (or 1st place in a 2 car grid) will give you a Rival Car Raffle where a random car can be rewarded from the grid. When you unlocked a new car, it will be added to your garage and can be selectable as a new car.
  - ðŸ’¡ There is also a random chance that no car will be unlocked from the shuffle.
    
2. When you have no Enthu points after a race, you can not earn a Rival Car Raffle.

### Results Summary
1. This screen displays a summary of your progress after finishing a race, changing cars, or resting.
2. The following are displayed in the results summary:
   - Race & ranking points history (past 12 weeks)
   - Skill Points: The amount of Skill Points earned based on Race Grade, total length of the race, etc. Skill points can be deducted based on the amount of collisions and offroading.
   - Driver (Skill Points): The total amount of skill points for the driver.
     - ðŸ’¡ Like in Enthusia, when the driver level increases, the total amount of Enthu points and recovery rate of Enthu Points increases.
  - Car (Skill Points): The total amount of skill points for the current.
     - ðŸ’¡ Like in Enthusia, when the car level increases, a new performance part is installed to the car. The maximum level of a car is 10. Increasing a car's performance does not affect the odds in a race.
  - Enthu Points: The amount of Enthu points recovered after a race.
    
3. Your ranking increases or decreases depending on the amount of ranking points won from the best 9 races out of the past 12 weeks. Keep in mind that changing cars or resting too much may negatively impact your ranking in Fithusim Life.

## Driving Revolution

1. In Driving Revolution, the goal is to master your driving skills. In this mode, you will be driving loaned cars across different stages.
   
2. There are currently a total of 5 stages (more are planned to be added in the future). Like in Enthusia, each stage contains 4 tests in the same location with loaner cars. In order to advance to the next stage, each test must earn at least a C or above.
   
3. Game Instructions:
   - When starting a Driving Revolution, the buttons will appear under the embed. The buttons are arrows in the first row and the acceleration/braking in the second row.
   - Inside of the embed, the grid of the game, your current position, and state (accelerating/braking) are displayed.
   - In the middle of the grid, there are 2 types of icons displayed:
     - Indicators (Green/Orange): A Green indicator is where the car should be accelerating and an Orange indicators is where the car should be braking.
     - Direction: The arrow represent the direction of the car that should steer to.
   - In order to score, you must choose the arrow that matches with the current arrow on the grid AND you must choose either the acceleration or braking that matches with the current indicator.
   - The grid changes periodically and you must select buttons that matches with the patterns above the embed until the test is over.
   - When the test is over, you will be given a cummulative score from a D (Miss) to a S (Perfect).
     - ðŸ’¡ In order to recieve a S score, you must have no scores of BAD or MISS.
